# [Docrastinate](http://docrastinate.com)

An planner based on my triptych organization system: calendar, projects & personal.
This is a very early version, especially the calendar column needs lots of love.
Unhost your plans at [docrastinate.com](http://docrastinate.com)!


## Unhosted

**This app allows you to use your own data storage!** This app is fully client-side without any server backend you need to trust! Find out more about the [Unhosted movement](http://unhosted.org). localStorage is used as fallback, so you can also use it offline.



## License

TL;DR: **Do anything you want as long as you credit me.**
